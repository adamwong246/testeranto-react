Fix the failing tests described in testeranto/reports/reactTests/src/react-test-renderer/component/test/web/web/tests.json and testeranto/reports/reactTests/src/react-test-renderer/component/test/web/web/logs.txt. DO NOT refactor beyond what is necessary. Always prefer minimal changes, focusing mostly on keeping the BDD tests passing
